  "self.caption": `I am a passionate front-end developer specializing in web design and development. I began self-learning in 2023 and successfully transitioned to the front-end development field in October 2024. My technical skills include HTML, SCSS, Vue (Vue2/Vue3), JavaScript, and Node.js, and I can quickly adapt to new technologies and projects.
After joining the workforce, I swiftly familiarized myself with the company's tech stack (such as Vue2/Vue3 and Git Flow) and gained a comprehensive understanding of the project development process. In my role, I actively assist in fulfilling PM requirements, ensuring that feature development is accurate and meets expectations. I also participate in daily discussions, offering constructive suggestions and responding promptly to feedback from colleagues.
As a team member, I have strong communication skills and collaborate efficiently with senior front-end colleagues and UI/UX designers, ensuring smooth project progress. I always maintain a cooperative attitude towards task assignments and am willing to work overtime when necessary to ensure the successful completion of projects.
I love engaging with people, enjoy the collaborative team environment, and look forward to working with more talented partners in the future to create outstanding products together!`,
